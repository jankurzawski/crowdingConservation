# Crowding Conservation

This repository contains the code to reproduce Figures 3A, 3B, 4, and 5 from the manuscript:

**Human V4 size predicts crowding distance**\
*Jan Kurzawski, Brenda Qiu, Noah Benson, Denis Pelli, Najib Majaj, Jonathan Winawer*

## Overview

The code in this repository is designed to:

- Recreate key figures from the study.
- Analyze the relationship between human V4 size and visual crowding distance.

## Figures

- **Figure 3A & 3B**: Visualize two example participants.
- **Figure 4**: Provides test-retest metrics across subjects.
- **Figure 5**: Examines predictive models for crowding based on V4 size.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:jk619/crowdingConservation.git
   ```
2. Run the provided scripts to generate the figures.

## Citation

If you use this code, please cite the original manuscript:

> Kurzawski, J., Qiu, B., Benson, N., Pelli, D., Majaj, N., & Winawer, J. (Year). Human V4 size predicts crowding distance.
